# Cleared v2: decisions log

Each entry has a date, the decision as it was taken, and its consequences for this repository. Path-level verdicts are in [keep-and-drop.md](keep-and-drop.md). Counts were taken on the `v2` branch at commit `bd496f1`.

## 2026-10-21: what Cleared v2 is

**Decision.** Cleared v2 is a harness for many parallel coding sessions. Claude Code and Codex sessions run in parallel, each in its own Docker container. A project lead session coordinates them. v2 also has memory, review by a model other than the author's, and human approval before any deploy, through the existing lock service (the release broker, `serve/release-broker.mjs`).

**Consequences.**
- Sessions are long-lived and run in containers. v1 lanes are one-shot CLI runs in host worktrees, opened by bash (`spawn-lane.sh`, `lane-run.sh`, `flow-lanes.sh`). The lane model is replaced, not ported.
- The release broker and its client `release-request.mjs` stay. So do the checks the broker runs before a merge, today in `merge-pr.sh`.
- Cross-model review stays. `review-pr.sh` (bash) has to exist in Node before milestone 4.
- The project lead becomes a session. The prompts of the v1 lead wake (`prompts/release.md`, `prompts/release-live.md`, `prompts/handover.md`, `prompts/talk.md`) are adapted.

## 2026-10-21: Node for the whole core, no bash

**Decision.** The whole core is written in Node. No bash script remains.

**Consequences.**
- The repository tracks 39 `.sh` files (`git ls-files '*.sh' | wc -l`). All 39 are removed in milestone 4.
- Some of them carry behavior v2 keeps, so that behavior has to exist in Node before the file goes:
  - `merge-pr.sh`: the guarded merge
  - `ask-validation.sh`: the approval request
  - `review-pr.sh`: cross-model review
  - `wake.sh`: the wake
  - `lib/ports.sh`: the port rules
  - `serve/install.sh`: the installer
  - `tracker.sh`, `lib/tracker/adapters/dispatch.sh`, `lib/tracker/adapters/linear.sh`, `lib/tracker/adapters/env.sh`, `lib/tracker/guard.sh`: tracker access
  - the `guard_text` function of `lib/common.sh`
- `.github/workflows/checks.yml` runs `bash -n` on every shell file. That step goes.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` lists bash and jq as requirements for the local suite. That list changes.
- The jq files under `prompts/` are run by `wake.sh`. Their content moves with the wake.
- 27 of the 36 files under `test/` name a `.sh` file (`grep -lE '[A-Za-z0-9_-]+\.sh' $(git ls-files test) | wc -l`). Tests of kept areas keep their cases and change their harness. Tests of dropped areas go.

## 2026-10-21: app login by password, no passkeys

**Decision.** The app signs the human in with a password. Passkeys are dropped.

**Consequences.**
- These files go: `app/lib/webauthn.mjs`, `app/lib/grant-socket.mjs`, `app/public/register.html`, `app/public/register.js` and `test/app-authenticator.mjs`.
- `cleared app passkey` (`app/main.mjs`) goes.
- Some files lose their passkey parts: `app/lib/actions.mjs`, `app/lib/notifications.mjs`, `app/lib/credentials.mjs`, `app/public/actions.js`, `app/public/notify.js` and `app/screenshots-actions.mjs`.
- Open: today a passkey confirms "Clear to land", "Send back" and turning notifications on, each time. What confirms these gestures with a password login is not decided.

## 2026-10-21: Claude Code first, then Codex

**Decision.** v2 supports Claude Code sessions first. Codex sessions follow.

**Consequences.**
- v1 requires the reviewer to be a different model from the one that wrote the change (README, Principles).
- Open: which model reviews the work of Claude Code sessions before Codex sessions exist.
- `lib/route.mjs`, which picks a model per role with fallbacks, is proposed for keep.

## 2026-10-21: what v2 keeps

**Decision.** v2 keeps:
- the tracker contract and adapters (`lib/tracker`), with the local adapter becoming the ticket store
- memory (`lib/memory`)
- the deploy lock service
- automatic and manual rollback
- the post deploy health watch
- the heartbeat and `cleared status`
- the fast lane rules on the real diff
- web notifications
- the private terms and secrets guard
- the SQLite ledger
- the app: the Node server, the snapshot, `app/DESIGN.md` and the en and fr catalog

**Consequences.**
- These paths stay:
  - `lib/tracker/`, `lib/memory/`, `lib/ledger.mjs`, `lib/release.mjs`, `lib/heartbeat.mjs`, `lib/fast-lane.mjs`
  - `lib/guard/`, `lib/notify.mjs`, `lib/notify/`, `lib/i18n.mjs`, `lib/i18n/`
  - `lib/board-collector.mjs`, `lib/board-report.mjs`, `lib/board-scrub.mjs`
  - `serve/release-broker.mjs`, `release-request.mjs`, `cleared` and `app/`
- The local adapter stores tickets, comments and history in `ledger.db` today. Its approval proof needs two system accounts and an Ed25519 key held by the human (docs/trackers.md).
- Open: the three system accounts mode is dropped, so what proves a human approval in the local store is not decided.
- Web notifications are kept. The `ntfy`, `telegram` and `email` adapters in `lib/notify/adapters/` are not named. Open.

## 2026-10-21: what v2 drops

**Decision.** v2 drops:
- the bash lanes
- the one-shot harness adapters (`claude -p`, `codex exec`)
- the terminal adapters (Orca, none)
- the permission translation per CLI
- the three system accounts default mode
- sudo
- bubblewrap
- the heavy operations lock
- passkeys
- the special Codex container mode
- every remaining bash script of the core

**Consequences.**
- Removed in milestone 4:
  - `adapters/` and `lib/contract.sh`
  - `lib/terminal/`
  - the lane scripts (`spawn-lane.sh`, `lane-run.sh`, `flow-lanes.sh`, `kill-lane.sh`, `tidy-lanes.sh`, `adopt-lane.sh`, `tell-lane.sh`, `push-lane.sh`)
  - `when-free.sh`, `host-state.sh` and `lib/screens.mjs`
  - `lead-command.mjs`, `serve/lead-actions.mjs` and `serve/check-harness.sh`
- `[permissions.*]`, `[terminal]`, `[adapter.claude]` and `[adapter.codex]` go from `agents.example.conf` and `docs/configuration.md`.
- `docs/security.md` loses its sections on the agents' account, bubblewrap, sudo and the heavy-command door.
- Some files only serve dropped parts but are not named in the decision. The static dashboard (`dashboard.sh`, `lib/dashboard.mjs`, its three units) and the decision flow of `talk.sh` (`decide.sh`, `confirm-decision.sh`) are examples. They are marked `proposed` in keep-and-drop.md and still need a decision.

## 2026-10-21: removals happen in milestone 4

**Decision.** Most removals happen in milestone 4.

**Consequences.**
- No milestone plan exists in the repository. Every removal in keep-and-drop.md is placed in M4 until one does.
- Until milestone 4, v1 files stay in the tree next to the v2 code.

## 2026-10-21: v1 is stopped without an archive

**Decision.** Makhtar decided not to archive the v1 state when stopping it, because it is not needed. The v1 services and timers are disabled.

**Consequences.**
- No copy of the v1 runtime state (ledger, lanes, worktrees, snapshot) is made before it stops. v2 starts from the repository, not from a v1 archive.
- The orchestrator confirmed that the v1 stop was executed and verified on 2026-10-21, including the disabled services and timers.
- The units `serve/` installs are still tracked: `cleared-wake.timer`, `cleared-dashboard-refresh.timer`, `cleared-legacy-import.timer` and their services. Their verdicts are in keep-and-drop.md.
